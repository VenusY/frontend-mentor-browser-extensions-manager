## Why I Built This Project

I built this project as part of a personal challenge to build more projects with React in order to become more comfortable with the library as it's one that's widely used in the tech industry.

I also wanted to gain more experience with CSS grid as it's a very powerful tool used in many websites to achieve dynamic two-dimensional layouts.
